# Symptom-Tracker-Healthcare

The Patient Symptom Tracker allows healthcare organizations to configure patient-facing symptom questionnaires dynamically using simple YAML files.
Patients can fill out forms generated from these configurations, and their submissions are handled through a lightweight backend API.

This project is designed to demonstrate modular, user-friendly healthcare solutions.
